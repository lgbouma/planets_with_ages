Lithwick and Wu, 2014 -- PNAS:
Secular Chaos and its application to Mercury, hot Jupiters, and organization of
planetary systems.

* To linear order in M, secular evolution ;+ intxns btwn rings, which represent
  the planets after their masses are smeared out over orbits.

* Though important in SS, not much work done on secular chaos

* Mercury is marginally on the limit of secular chaos. Generally, the innermost 
  planet is most susceptible to large variations (ref 21).

* Lithwick & Wu earlier found that secular chaos could provide another high
  eccentricity migration mechanism for HJs.
  For this to work, you need a system with >= 3 giant planets.
  But the data allow this (long term RV might falsify. However this is a
  relatively strong assumption.).

* A reminder: high e migration is favored, b/c most of the HJs are >2a_roche.
  (a_roche for tidal brekaup).

* Raising the initial AMD leads to more efficient HJ formation

* Their mechanism would predict that HJs have low masses, for giant planets.
  This is what the RV surveys observe (Msini <~ 2MJ, while further out get many
  Msini>~2M_J planets).

* Planetary systems might be organized by secular chaos: if they maintain
  states of marginal stability at all times.
  
* Speculation:
  
  Think of AMD as the free energy.

  Conjecture that secular chaos drives planetary systems to split up
  (equipartition) the AMD btwn planets.

  Initially, planets merge or are ejected until the AMD is s.t. neighboring
  planets do not collide in a state of equipartition.

  Then, secular evoln over long timescales is set by fluctuations about
  equipartition.

  One planet gains enough of the AMD that it merges with a neighbor, or is
  ejected, or approaches the star.

  On longer timescales, fluctuations can once again lead to instability.

Weiss+ 2018:
CKS V: Peas in a Pod -- Kepler multis are similar in size and regularly spaced.

* Using updated radii and semimaj axes

* To analyze distributions of planet pair radii ratio, and of semimaj axis
  ratios, the trick is coming up w/ independent, detectability-corrected
  ratios.
  To do this, Weiss came up with a nice monte carlo procedure that involves
  sampling, computing SNRs, and dropping non-detected pairs.

* In this manner, looks at R_j+1 / R_j distribution.
  And a_j+1 / a_j distribution.

* Finally, computes separations in units of mutual hill radii.
  This requires a mass estimate of planets, for which Weiss+Marcy14 M(R)
  relation used.
  
  R_H = (m_j + m_{j+1} / 3Mstar )^{1/3}  (a_j + a_{j+1})/2

  is the mutual hill radius of two planets. The separation in units of mutual
  hill radii is then

  Î” = (a_{j+1} - a_j)/R_H

***
  NB even though the orbital separations of Kepler planets in units of AU are
  small compared to the SS, in units of mutual hill radii, this is not the
  case!!
***

* Nice summary of Dawson+16:

  if in situ formation is dominant mode of planet formn, then planets that
  formed in gas-rich environments likely have small mutual hill separations and
  large (>1%) gas fractions, whereas planets that formed in gas poor disks likely
  have large mtuual hil separations and low (<1%) gas fractions.

  (OFC, must exclude planets whose gas fractions are depleted from photoevapn)

Are there more multis around metal-rich stars?

Are there fewer multis (2,3,4) around the oldest stars?
  (AKA: does the occurrence rate of multi-transiting systems change in time?)

For planets >3Gyr, what fraction of detected systems are single?
  What fraction are multi?
Ditto for planets <3Gyr?

Does the average separation between planet pairs in multis (in units of mutual
hill radii) increase for the oldest multis?

Do the innermost planets tend to be detected further away from the star in the
oldest systems?
