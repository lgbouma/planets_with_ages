goal: plot simple things vs exoplanet age.

exoplanets.org: don't have an age column.

Made plots. looked at them. yup those age error bars are big.

Was recommended TOPCAT to do the big crossmatch. but it requires weird java
shit, and doesn't immediately install nicely

Working with Sanders and Das 2018 catalog. There are apparently a few hundred
thousand objects with exactly RA=140.977121. I doubt it.

So what? Their catalog is crap?

Maybe look at galactic coords and it'll be better...
Or maybe they BINNED the stars to their healpix values?

Possible. There are 4.9e6 stars in their catalog.

And 1.9e5 unique RA values.

That's clearly crap.

Well... there are 3.9e6 stars with unique GALACTIC LONGITUDES (l). So perhaps 
that's a better place to start. More or less same with latitudes.

(NB there are _some_ with nans)
