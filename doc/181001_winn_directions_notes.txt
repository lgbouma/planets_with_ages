- 2-sample AD instead of 2-sample KS make things look slightly statistically
  stronger. (Still ~3sigma difference, p~=2e-3, but age-cut independent).

* do a detectability of a transit signal test (vs age), similar to Petigura's
  test in appendix B of Petigura+ 2018.

  W not even worth redoing. Petigura did it. doesn't matter!

W can we look at "age residual" or "metallicity residual" vs a/Rstar? -- fit a
  line to age vs metallicity. subtract it out.

W can make same plot for the wide field surveys -- e.g., "all WASP or HAT
  planets". 
  e.g., Bonomo+ for the homogeneous spectroscopic WASP results
  Stassun et al Gaia redetermination of planet parameters.

  if there is no homogeneous source, ignore the idea.

W in age vs a/Rstar. do one point per star -- innermost point.

* planet occ vs age correlations.
  we enjoy relations of the form:

    f_occ ~ 10^([M/H] * beta).

  What about we derive some relations of the form:

    f_occ ~ 10^([age] * zeta).

  In particular, for HJs, I'm not sure there's much EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE that the
  HJ occ-metallicity correlation should be interpreted when ignoring age.
  
  Surely age matters too. E.g., Figure 1 of Levrard et al 2009, puts most HJs
  as <1Gyr stable, almost all as <5Gyr (except OGLE-TR-111b).
  HOWEVER this figure is perhaps making a terrible assumption that Qstar: =
  1e6. Penev+ (2018) quotes at least some HJs with Qstar(Ptide) = 1e7, perhaps
  up to Qstar=1e8.

  If this Qstar=1e8 is typical, then the tidal infall in hubble time isn't so
  relevant.

  HOWEVER the above type of relation would make a point. E.g., "it doesn't make
  sense for Petigura's beta=3.4 result to be much stronger than FV05's beta~=2
  result. Perhaps differences come from age."
    
* tidal theory component: over 10 Gyr, stellar evolution matters.
  so does the stellar spin rate.
  if we're gonna do numerical models, we need to the right ones.

  adot/a  = (planet tidal damping part) + (stellar tidal damping part)
          = (stellar tidal damping part)     [assuming synchronous]
          = [assume e=0]
          = - 9 * (1/Qstar) (Mp/Mstar) (Rstar/a)^5 ( n - Ωstar )

  for n = 2π/P_orb.

  so you at least need Mstar, Rstar, and Ωstar.

  Ωstar has a contribution from the stellar wind too. You can't ignore it and
  produce believeable population-level results, I don't think.

W ignore omega_star
  ignore rstar evolution
  just do the single ODE

W age vs Rp: what is that giant planet around the oldest star??
  is it a HJ?

* so we should be using Kalo's code.

  option 1) i contact him and we get an install working on my linux box.
  (install instructions are non-existent)

  option 2) i contact him and we collaborate -- ask him to run some specific
            models.
