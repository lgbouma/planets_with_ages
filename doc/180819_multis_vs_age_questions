Are there fewer multis (2,3,4) around the oldest stars?
  (AKA: does the occurrence rate of multi-transiting systems change in time?)

  --> Weiss+18, CKS VI indicates no (Fig 5, since [Fe/H]~age, and low Fe/H still
  has some multis), compared to singles in mag-limited samples.

Are there more multis around metal-rich stars?

  --> Weiss+18, CKS VI indicates no, compared to singles in mag-limited samples.

For planets >3Gyr, what fraction of detected systems are single?
  What fraction are multi?
Ditto for planets <3Gyr?
  [or, ask the same question in quartiles of age]

COMPARE MULTIS TO MULTIS:

1. Does the average separation between planet pairs in multis (in units of mutual
hill radii) increase for the oldest multis?

2. Does the innermost planet of a multi tend to be detected further away from the
host star in the oldest systems?

-----

Main question:
How does the number of planets per system scale with the host star's
metallicity?

Petigura+ CKS IV's results are for the average number of planets per star.

The above question is closer to the Zhu+18 Kepler TTV+LAMOST study, which
targets the true multiplicity function, and the fraction of stars with planets.

3. How does the average number of transiting planets per stellar system change
with metallicity?
(AKA: I want Weiss+18 CKS VI's Figure 1, the detected system multiplicity
function, for high and low metallicities)

(Is it really the case that more metal-rich stars don't a larger number of
detected transiting planets per system?!
This would be weird...)

To answer questions 1,2,3: we need to reconstruct Weiss+18's CKS VI multi
samples.
She provides enough details to do this, I think.

[though I think she also did it w/ gaia parameters? well, i have the CKS VII
table and this is probably enough]
