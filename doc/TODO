* Focus, at first, on hot Jupiters. Get the CKS sample. Calculate the
  average NPPS in the Prot bins below. Do you see evolution? Less HJs per star
  around the slowest rotators? (-> tidal infall!)

* We know that isochrone ages from Kepler are hard to interpret. But for fixed
  Mstar, what if we looked at the population in different stellar rotation
  period bins?
  i.e., for G dwarfs, look at Rp vs Porb maps for Prot in
   * 30-25 days
   * 25-20 days
   * 20-15 days,
  etc. We know this corresponds to a SEQUENTIAL ordering in age. This is all we
  care about, for a correctly asked question. Should look at calibrations in
  detail, but Prot=10days <~> 1Gyr, Prot=20days <~> 3Gyr,
  Prot=25days <~> 4.57Gyr, etc.

  * in particular, you want to do this for the AVERAGE NUMBER OF PLANETS PER
    STAR. Focus, at first, on hot Jupiters. Get the CKS sample. Calculate the
    average NPPS in the above bins. Do you see evolution? Less HJs per star
    around the slowest rotators? (-> tidal infall!)

  If you're interested in this path, check out reviews on spindown and angular
  momentum evolution:
  * Barnes 2009
  * Irwin and Bouvier 2009
  * Mamajek 2009
  and perhaps two of the main calibration papers:
  * Barnes 2007
  * Mamajek and Hillenbrand 2008.
  But be aware that inherent scatter can mess up interpretations. For Hyades
    (600Myr) and Coma clusters, ~40% Prot scatter -- quoted by
  * Collier Cameron et al 2009.

  Note that looking at R_HK indicators (measured for CKS) is a possible sanity
  check, since this also evolves over time.

* stellar rotation period vs age...
  * cross-matching gaia ages vs rotation period measurements: can we
    check gyrochronology?

* We know that one path for unbinding star clusters is colliding them with
  molecular clouds inside the galactic disk.  But what happens to a planetary
  system if it collides with a molecular cloud? Does it become less bound? How
  should the architecture evolve?

READING

* I need to download Torres' catalog of stars. And be sure to flag them as
  being interesting w/ TESS. (& maybe cross-check against OC WG?)

* review Jeffries 2006 for discussion of Li depletion in OCs

* review Werner+ 2006 "from disks to planets" Spitzer key program

* Gaia will be used, by someone, to extend these samples. Maybe to bigger
  distances than 50pc. Who will do this? And by when?
   
* get the table of Cantat-Gaudin+ 2018 arxiv, Gaia DR2 open clusters

* ditto, for Castro-Ginard+ 2018, found 30 OCs in TGAS, half of them within
  500pc.

* search: Vallenari+ ~late 2018, who will produce ages for Cantat-Gaudin et
  al 2018's open clusters

* Kuhn, Hillenbrand+ gaia dr2 recent lists of updated cluster members

* Masseron & Gilmore 2015, Martig+ 2016 -- there are spectroscopic indicator of
  GIANT STAR masses... [C & N abundances]

catalogs:

* K Luhman, Herrmann, Mamajek et al 2018, new young stars and brown dwarfs in
  the upper sco association.
