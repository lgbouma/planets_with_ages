NGC 2516, AKA the "southern beehive" or "sprinter" is a rich, close OC that
will be in the CVZ. worth dedicating some effort to studying!  it looks like
the richest, nearest OC in either of TESS' CVZs.

47 Tuc (NGC 104) may receive 2 sectors (54 days) of coverage

NGC 2632 (the actual beehive) won't be observed -- too close to ecliptic

-----

In the first few sectors (90deg thru say 150deg ecl long)

NGC 2112 -- ~Gyr old, rich cluster at 1kpc

Platais 5 -- <100Myr, at few hundred pc.

NGC 2323 (M 50) -- few hundred Myr

Ruprecht 64 -- a close, few hundred Myr cluster, might receive 2 sectors

NGC 2548 (M 48)
