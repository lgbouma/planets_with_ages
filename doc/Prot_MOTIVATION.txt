Isochrone ages from Kepler are hard to interpret. But for fixed Mstar, what if
we looked at the population in different stellar rotation period bins?  i.e.,
for G dwarfs, look at Rp vs Porb maps for Prot in
   * 30-25 days
   * 25-20 days
   * 20-15 days,
etc. We know this corresponds to a SEQUENTIAL ordering in age. This is all we
care about, for a correctly asked question. Should look at calibrations in
detail, but Prot=10days <~> 1Gyr, Prot=20days <~> 3Gyr,
Prot=25days <~> 4.57Gyr, etc.

So here, we get the CKS planet sample. If we want to do a good study, we also
need to get the CKS STELLAR sample, as describe e.g., by Petigura+ 2017 in CKS
IV, or by Fulton & Petigura 2018 in CKS VII.

We then want to calculate the average NPPS in the above bins. Do you see
evolution? Less HJs per star around the slowest rotators? (-> tidal infall!)
The gap moving? (-> photoevaporation).

If we could get to the point where we can reproduce something similar to FIGURE
4 from Petigura+ 2017, we will be in good shape. Notice though that focusing on
particular MASSES might be a pre-req, and could mess our lives up.

A workaround could be to instead use the rotation periods to derive
gyrochronological ages. Barnes (2009) gave an informal summarized age relation
in his Eq 5.3:

    log(t_gyro/yr) = 1/n * (logP - loga - b*log(B-V-c))

for
    a=0.770+/-0.014
    b=0.553+/-0.052
    c=0.472+/-0.027.

For gyro ages below around ~4Gyr, this should be pretty good at giving us
RELATIVE ages. (OFC we really want to know the timescales over which the
planetary systems are evolving, but we'll take whatever the data give us.)

We could also use age age from the log(R_HK') index. Mamajek (2009), based on
Mamajek and Hillenbrand 2008, gives:

    log(t_RHK/yr) = -38.053 - 17.912 log10(R_HK') - 1.6675 log10(R_HK')^2.

Might as well try both...

But be aware that inherent scatter can mess up interpretations. For Hyades
(600Myr) and Coma clusters, ~40% Prot scatter -- quoted by Collier Cameron et
al 2009.
