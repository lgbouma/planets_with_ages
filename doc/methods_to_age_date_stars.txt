Photometric ages (isochrones)

Asteroseismic ages (for >G dwarfs, w Kepler or maybe TESS asteroseismology)

Open cluster membership

Moving group membership

Loose association membership

MS + asteroseismic binaries -- widely separated binaries w/ asteroseismic companions

Stellar kinematics -- on a population level (u,v,w tells you whether stars are
	"old" or "young").

MS + WD companions, get WD cooling age from the cooling time argument
